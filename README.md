This project demonstrates a simple api that manages boats and loads with basic authentication and authorization functionality. See "api_spec.pdf" for comprehensive api documentation.

This repo also contains a collection of Postman tests and a corresponding environment. To run the full test collection, you need to generate two users and update the environment variables "jwt_1" and "jwt_2".
